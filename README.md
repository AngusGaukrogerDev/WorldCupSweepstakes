# World Cup Sweepstakes Allocator - Frontend
Users enter their name and email to be randomly allocated a team in the world cup pool. The program communicates with a REST API connected to a database hosted on the backend to ensure that the same team can't ba allocated twice. On team allocation, an email is sent to the user.

PM for backend code.
